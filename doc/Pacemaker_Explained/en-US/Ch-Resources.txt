== What is a Cluster Resource ==

indexterm:[Resource,Description]

The role of a resource agent is to abstract the service it provides
and present a consistent view to the cluster, which allows the cluster
to be agnostic about the resources it manages.

The cluster doesn't need to understand how the resource works because
it relies on the resource agent to do the right thing when given a
+start+, +stop+ or +monitor+ command.

For this reason it is crucial that resource agents are well tested. 

Typically resource agents come in the form of shell scripts, however
they can be written using any technology (such as C, Python or Perl)
that the author is comfortable with.

== Supported Resource Classes ==

indexterm:[Resource,Classes]
anchor:s-resource-supported[Supported Resource Classes]

There are three basic classes of agents supported by Pacemaker.
In order of encouraged usage they are:

=== Open Cluster Framework ===

indexterm:[Resource,OCF]
indexterm:[OCF,Resources]
indexterm:[Open Cluster Framework,Resources]

The OCF standard
footnote:[
http://www.opencf.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/specs/ra/resource-agent-api.txt?rev=HEAD - at least as it relates to resource agents.
] footnote:[
The Pacemaker implementation has been somewhat extended from the OCF
Specs, but none of those changes are incompatible with the original
OCF specification.
]
is basically an extension of the Linux Standard Base conventions for
init scripts to:

* support parameters,
* make them self describing and
* extensible

OCF specs have strict definitions of the exit codes that actions must return.
footnote:[
Included with the cluster is the ocf-tester script, which can be
useful in this regard.
]

The cluster follows these specifications exactly, and giving the wrong
exit code will cause the cluster to behave in ways you will likely
find puzzling and annoying.  In particular, the cluster needs to
distinguish a completely stopped resource from one which is in some
erroneous and indeterminate state.

Parameters are passed to the script as environment variables, with the
special prefix +OCF_RESKEY_+.  So, a parameter which the user thinks
of as ip it will be passed to the script as +OCF_RESKEY_ip+.  The
number and purpose of the parameters is completely arbitrary, however
your script should advertise any that it supports using the
+meta-data+ command.
        

The OCF class is the most preferred one as it is an industry standard,
highly flexible (allowing parameters to be passed to agents in a
non-positional manner) and self-describing.

For more information, see the
http://www.linux-ha.org/wiki/OCF_Resource_Agents[reference] and
xref:ap-ocf[].

=== Linux Standard Base ===
indexterm:[Resource,LSB]
indexterm:[LSB,Resources]
indexterm:[Linus Standard Base,Resources]

LSB resource agents are those found in '/etc/init.d'.

Generally they are provided by the OS/distribution and, in order to be used with the cluster, they must conform to the LSB Spec.
footnote:[
See
http://refspecs.linux-foundation.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/iniscrptact.html
for the LSB Spec (as it relates to init scripts).
]

Many distributions claim LSB compliance but ship with broken init
scripts.  To see if your init script is LSB-compatible, see the FAQ
entry xref:ap-lsb[].  The most common problems are:

* Not implementing the status operation at all
* Not observing the correct exit status codes for start/stop/status actions
* Starting a started resource returns an error (this violates the LSB spec)
* Stopping a stopped resource returns an error (this violates the LSB spec)

=== Legacy Heartbeat ===
indexterm:[Resource,Heartbeat (legacy)]
indexterm:[Heartbeat,Legacy Resources]

Version 1 of Heartbeat came with its own style of resource agents and
it is highly likely that many people have written their own agents
based on its conventions.  To enable administrators to continue to use
these agents, they are supported by the new cluster manager
footnote:[
See http://wiki.linux-ha.org/HeartbeatResourceAgent for more information
]

=== STONITH ===
indexterm:[Resource,STONITH]
indexterm:[STONITH,Resources]

There is also an additional class, STONITH, which is used exclusively
for fencing related resources.  This is discussed later in
xref:ch-stonith[].

== Properties ==

These values tell the cluster which script to use for the resource, where to find that script and what standards it conforms to.

indexterm:[Resource,Field,class]
|The standard the script conforms to. Allowed values: +heartbeat+, +lsb+, +ocf+, +stonith+

|The OCF spec allows multiple vendors to supply the same
 ResourceAgent. To use the OCF resource agents supplied with
 Heartbeat, you should specify +heartbeat+ here.

|=========================================================

Resource definitions can be queried with the `crm_resource` tool. For example

[source,Bash]
crm_resource --resource Email --query-xml

might produce:

.An example LSB resource
[source,XML]
<primitive id="Email" class="lsb" type="exim"/>

[NOTE]
One of the main drawbacks to LSB resources is that they do not allow any parameters!

Example for an OCF resource:

.An example OCF resource
[source,XML]
-------
<primitive id="Public-IP" class="ocf" type="IPaddr" provider="heartbeat">
   <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip">
      <nvpair id="public-ip-addr" name="ip" value="1.2.3.4"/>
   </instance_attributes>
</primitive>
-------

Or, finally for the equivalent legacy Heartbeat resource:

.An example Heartbeat resource
[source,XML]
-------
<primitive id="Public-IP-legacy" class="heartbeat" type="IPaddr">
   <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip-legacy">
      <nvpair id="public-ip-addr-legacy" name="1" value="1.2.3.4"/>
   </instance_attributes>
</primitive>
-------

[NOTE]
======
Heartbeat resources take only ordered and unnamed parameters.  The
supplied name therefore indicates the order in which they are passed
to the script.  Only single digit values are allowed.

== Resource Options ==

anchor:s-resource-options[Resource Options]
Options are used by the cluster to decide how your resource should
behave and can be easily set using the `--meta` option of the
`crm_resource` command.

If you performed the following commands on the previous LSB Email resource

[source,Bash]
-------
crm_resource --meta --resource Email --set-parameter priority --property-value 100
crm_resource --meta --resource Email --set-parameter multiple-active --property-value block
-------

the resulting resource definition would be

.An LSB resource with cluster options
[source,XML]
-------
<primitive id="Email" class="lsb" type="exim">
   <meta_attributes id="meta-email">
      <nvpair id="email-priority" name="priority" value="100"/>
      <nvpair id="email-active" name="multiple-active" value="block"/>
   </meta_attributes>
</primitive>
-------

== Setting Global Defaults for Resource Options ==

anchor:s-resource-defaults[Resource Defaults]
To set a default value for a resource option, simply add it to the
+rsc_defaults+ section with `crm_attribute`. Thus,

[source,Bash]
crm_attribute --type rsc_defaults --attr-name is-managed --attr-value false

would prevent the cluster from starting or stopping any of the
resources in the configuration (unless of course the individual
resources were specifically enabled and had +is-managed+ set to
+true+).

== Instance Attributes ==

The scripts of some resource classes (LSB not being one of them) can
be given parameters which determine how they behave and which instance
of a service they control.

If your resource agent supports parameters, you can add them with the
`crm_resource` command. For instance

[source,Bash]
crm_resource --resource Public-IP --set-parameter ip --property-value 1.2.3.4

would create an entry in the resource like this:

.An example OCF resource with instance attributes
[source,XML]
-------
<primitive id="Public-IP" class="ocf" type="IPaddr" provider="heartbeat">
   <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip">
      <nvpair id="public-ip-addr" name="ip" value="1.2.3.4"/>
   </instance_attributes>
</primitive>
-------

For an OCF resource, the result would be an environment variable
called +OCF_RESKEY_ip+ with a value of +1.2.3.4+.

The list of instance attributes supported by an OCF script can be
found by calling the resource script with the `meta-data` command.
The output contains an XML description of all the supported
attributes, their purpose and default values.

== Resource Operations ==

=== Monitoring Resources for Failure ===


By default, the cluster will not ensure your resources are still
healthy.  To instruct the cluster to do this, you need to add a
+monitor+ operation to the resource's definition.
        
.An OCF resource with a recurring health check
[source,XML]
-------
<primitive id="Public-IP" class="ocf" type="IPaddr" provider="heartbeat">
  <operations>
     <op id="public-ip-check" name="monitor" interval="60s"/>
  </operations>
  <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip">
     <nvpair id="public-ip-addr" name="ip" value="1.2.3.4"/>
  </instance_attributes>
</primitive>
-------

.Properties of an Operation
[width="95%",cols="1m,6<",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================

|Field
|Description

|id
|Your name for the action. Must be unique.

|name
|The action to perform. Common values: +monitor+, +start+, +stop+

|interval

|How frequently (in seconds) to perform the operation. Default value:
 +0+, meaning never.

|timeout
|How long to wait before declaring the action has failed.

|requires

|What conditions need to be satisfied before this action
 occurs. Allowed values:

* 'nothing' - The cluster may start this resource at any time

* 'quorum' - The cluster can only start this resource if a majority of
  the configured nodes are active

* 'fencing' - The cluster can only start this resource if a majority
  of the configured nodes are active _and_ any failed or unknown nodes
  have been powered off.

STONITH resources default to +nothing+, and all others default to
+fencing+ if STONITH is enabled and +quorum+ otherwise.
                
|on-fail
|The action to take if this action ever fails. Allowed values:

* 'ignore' - Pretend the resource did not fail

* 'block' - Don't perform any further operations on the resource

* 'stop' - Stop the resource and do not start it elsewhere

* 'restart' - Stop the resource and start it again (possibly on a different node)

* 'fence' - STONITH the node on which the resource failed

* 'standby' - Move _all_ resources away from the node on which the resource failed

The default for the +stop+ operation is +fence+ when STONITH is
enabled and +block+ otherwise. All other operations default to +stop+.

|enabled
|If +false+, the operation is treated as if it does not exist. Allowed
 values: +true+, +false+

|=========================================================


=== Setting Global Defaults for Operations ===

anchor:s-operation-defaults[Operation Defaults]
To set a default value for a operation option, simply add it to the
+op_defaults+ section with `crm_attribute`. Thus,

[source,Bash]
crm_attribute --type op_defaults --attr-name timeout --attr-value 20s


would default each operation's +timeout+ to 20 seconds.  If an
operation's definition also includes a value for +timeout+, then that
value would be used instead (for that operation only).
      
==== When Resources Take a Long Time to Start/Stop ====

There are a number of implicit operations that the cluster will always
perform - +start+, +stop+ and a non-recurring +monitor+ operation
(used at startup to check the resource isn't already active).  If one
of these is taking too long, then you can create an entry for them and
simply specify a new value.

.An OCF resource with custom timeouts for its implicit actions     
[source,XML]
-------
<primitive id="Public-IP" class="ocf" type="IPaddr" provider="heartbeat">
  <operations>
     <op id="public-ip-startup" name="monitor" interval="0" timeout="90s"/>
     <op id="public-ip-start" name="start" interval="0" timeout="180s"/>
     <op id="public-ip-stop" name="stop" interval="0" timeout="15min"/>
  </operations>
  <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip">
     <nvpair id="public-ip-addr" name="ip" value="1.2.3.4"/>
  </instance_attributes>
</primitive>
-------

==== Multiple Monitor Operations ====

Provided no two operations (for a single resource) have the same name
and interval you can have as many monitor operations as you like.  In
this way you can do a superficial health check every minute and
progressively more intense ones at higher intervals.

To tell the resource agent what kind of check to perform, you need to
provide each monitor with a different value for a common parameter.
The OCF standard creates a special parameter called +OCF_CHECK_LEVEL+
for this purpose and dictates that it is _"made available to the
resource agent without the normal +OCF_RESKEY+ prefix"_.
        
Whatever name you choose, you can specify it by adding an
+instance_attributes+ block to the op tag.  Note that it is up to each
resource agent to look for the parameter and decide how to use it.
        
.An OCF resource with two recurring health checks, performing different levels of checks - specified via +OCF_CHECK_LEVEL+.
[source,XML]
-------
<primitive id="Public-IP" class="ocf" type="IPaddr" provider="heartbeat">
   <operations>
      <op id="public-ip-health-60" name="monitor" interval="60">
         <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip-depth-60">
            <nvpair id="public-ip-depth-60" name="OCF_CHECK_LEVEL" value="10"/>
         </instance_attributes>
      </op>
      <op id="public-ip-health-300" name="monitor" interval="300">
         <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip-depth-300">
            <nvpair id="public-ip-depth-300" name="OCF_CHECK_LEVEL" value="20"/>
       </instance_attributes>
     </op>
   </operations>
   <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip">
       <nvpair id="public-ip-level" name="ip" value="1.2.3.4"/>
   </instance_attributes>
</primitive>
-------

==== Disabling a Monitor Operation ====

The easiest way to stop a recurring monitor is to just delete it.
However, there can be times when you only want to disable it
temporarily.  In such cases, simply add +enabled="false"+ to the
operation's definition.

.Example of an OCF resource with a disabled health check     
[source,XML]
-------
<primitive id="Public-IP" class="ocf" type="IPaddr" provider="heartbeat">
   <operations>
      <op id="public-ip-check" name="monitor" interval="60s" enabled="false"/>
   </operations>
   <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip">
      <nvpair id="public-ip-addr" name="ip" value="1.2.3.4"/>
   </instance_attributes>
</primitive>
-------

This can be achieved from the command-line by executing

[source,Bash]
cibadmin -M -X ‘<op id="public-ip-check" enabled="false"/>'

Once you've done whatever you needed to do, you can then re-enable it with

[source,Bash]
cibadmin -M -X ‘<op id="public-ip-check" enabled="true"/>'
