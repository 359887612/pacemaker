== What Is STONITH ==

STONITH is an acronym for Shoot-The-Other-Node-In-The-Head and it
protects your data from being corrupted by rogue nodes or concurrent
access.

Just because a node is unresponsive, this doesn't mean it isn't
accessing your data. The only way to be 100% sure that your data is
safe, is to use STONITH so we can be certain that the node is truly
offline, before allowing the data to be accessed from another node.


STONITH also has a role to play in the event that a clustered service
cannot be stopped. In this case, the cluster uses STONITH to force the
whole node offline, thereby making it safe to start the service
elsewhere.

== What STONITH Device Should You Use ==

It is crucial that the STONITH device can allow the cluster to
differentiate between a node failure and a network one.

The biggest mistake people make in choosing a STONITH device is to
use remote power switch (such as many on-board IMPI controllers) that
shares power with the node it controls. In such cases, the cluster
cannot be sure if the node is really offline, or active and suffering
from a network fault.

Likewise, any device that relies on the machine being active (such as
SSH-based "devices" used during testing) are inappropriate.

== Differences of STONITH Resources ==

Stonith resources are somewhat special in Pacemaker.

In previous versions, only "running" resources could be used by
Pacemaker for fencing.  This requirement has been relaxed to allow
other parts of the cluster (such as resources like DRBD) to reliably
initiate fencing. footnote:[Fencing a node while Pacemaker was moving
stonith resources around would otherwise fail]

Now all nodes have access to their definitions and instantiate them
on-the-fly when needed.

[NOTE]
===========
To disable a fencing device/resource, 'target-role' can be set as you would for a normal resource.
===========

[NOTE]
===========
To prevent a specific node from using a fencing device, location constraints will work as expected.
===========

[IMPORTANT]
===========

Currently there is a limitation that fencing resources may only have a
one set of meta-attributes and one set of instance-attributes.  This
can be revisited if it becomes a significant limitation for people.

===========

== Configuring STONITH ==

[NOTE]
===========

Both configuration shells include functionality to simplify the
process below, particularly the step for deciding which parameters are
required.  However since this document deals only with core
components, you should refer to the Stonith chapter of +Clusters from
Scratch+ for those details.

===========

. Find the correct driver: +stonith_admin --list-installed+

. Find the required parameters associated with the device: +stonith_admin --metadata --agent <agent name>+

. Create a file called +stonith.xml+ containing a primitive resource
  with a class of 'stonith', a type of <agent name> and a parameter
  for each of the values returned in step 2.

. If the device does not know how to fence nodes based on their uname,
  you may also need to set the special +pcmk_host_map+ parameter.  See
  +man stonithd+ for details.

. If the device does not support the list command, you may also need
  to set the special +pcmk_host_list+ and/or +pcmk_host_check+
  parameters.  See +man stonithd+ for details.

. If the device does not expect the victim to be specified with the
  port parameter, you may also need to set the special
  +pcmk_host_argument+ parameter. See +man stonithd+ for details.

. Upload it into the CIB using cibadmin: +cibadmin -C -o resources --xml-file stonith.xml+

. Set stonith-enabled to true. +crm_attribute -t crm_config -n stonith-enabled -v true+

. Once the stonith resource is running, you can test it by executing:
  +stonith_admin --reboot nodename+. Although you might want to stop the
  cluster on that machine first.

=== Example ===

Assuming we have an chassis containing four nodes and an IPMI device
active on 10.0.0.1, then we would chose the fence_ipmilan driver in step
2 and obtain the following list of parameters

fence_ipmilan is an I/O Fencing agent which can be used with machines controlled by IPMI. This agent calls support software using ipmitool (http://ipmitool.sf.net/).

To use fence_ipmilan with HP iLO 3 you have to enable lanplus option (lanplus / -P) and increase wait after operation to 4 seconds (power_wait=4 / -T 4)</longdesc>

from which we would create a STONITH resource fragment that might look
like this:

<primitive id="Fencing" class="stonith" type="fence_ipmilan" >
  <instance_attributes id="Fencing-params" >
    <nvpair id="Fencing-passwd" name="passwd" value="testuser" />
    <nvpair id="Fencing-login" name="login" value="abc123" />
    <nvpair id="Fencing-ipaddr" name="ipaddr" value="10.0.0.1" />
    <nvpair id="Fencing-pcmk_host_list" name="pcmk_host_list" value="pcmk-1 pcmk-2" />
  </instance_attributes>
  <operations >
    <op id="Fencing-monitor-10m" interval="10m" name="monitor" timeout="300s" />
  </operations>
</primitive>

And finally, since we disabled it earlier, we need to re-enable STONITH.

== Advanced Fencing Configurations ==

Some people consider that having one fencing device is a single point
of failure footnote:[Not true, since a node or resource must fail
before fencing even has a chance to], others prefer removing the node
from the storage and network instead of turning it off.

Whatever the reason, Pacemaker supports fencing nodes with multiple
devices through a feature called fencing topologies.

Simply create the individual devices as you normally would and then
define one or more fencing levels in the fencing-topology section in
the configuration.

* Each level is attempted in +ascending index+ order
* If a device fails, +processing terminates+ for the current level (optimized boolean logic) and the next is attempted
* If the operation succeeds for all the listed devices in a level, the level is deemed to have passed
* Processing stops +when a level has passed+ or there are no more levels to try

Some suggested uses of topologies include:

* try poison-pill and fail back to power
* try disk and network, and fall back to power if either fails
* initiate a kdump and then poweroff the node
